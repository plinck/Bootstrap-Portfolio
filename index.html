                        <p>Paul graduated from Purdue University in 1987 with a BS in
                            Computer Science. His first job after college was at Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).
                            There he worked on a large variety of software development projects for clients across
                            the US.

                            Later, he co-founded a company specializing in software architecture for
                            large, leading edge applications.

                            Since then he has been consulting in a variety of industries and technologies.
                            His primary focus in most recent years is in the Home Automation
                            industry developing software to automate homes and businesses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These days Paul spends his time developing mobile and web applications with the
                            latest technologies including Swift/iOS, C#, and full stack web development (e.g.
                            HTML/CSS/Javascript).
                            He is highly skilled in tools and technology supporting the latest software development
                            trends.
                        </p>
                        <p>Paul loves to exercise mainly swimming, cycling and running. He has completed over 80
                            triathlons
                            including 23 Full Ironman Races.
                        </p>
                        <p>The picture shows Paul crossing the finish line in the Ironman
                            World Championship in Kona, Hawaii in 2017. This was Paul's 3rd time competing in the World
                            Championship,
                            and this time was extra special. Paul had just completed a year of surgeries and treatment
                            for
                            Cancer. He qualified for the race in late 2015, but was diagnosed with cancer in 2016 and
                            was in
                            treatment from June 2016 to June 2017. He completed this race in October 2017.
